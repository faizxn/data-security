* A Traditional Firewall - provides stateful inspection of network traffic. It allows or blocks traffic 
based on state.. port.. and protocol and filters traffic based on administrator-defined rules..

* A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) - does this and so much more. In addition to access control NGFWs can
block modern threats such as advanced malware and application-layer attacks. 

According to Gartner definition, a next-generation firewall must include

	+ Standard Firewall Capabilities like Stateful Inspection
	+ Integrated Intrusion Prevention (IPS)
	+ Application Awareness and Control and Block risky Apps
	+ Threat intelligence sources
